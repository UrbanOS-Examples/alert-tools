### Typescript Node Starter Boilerplate - bmitchinson

-   eslint with prettier
-   jest with coverage
-   typescript configuration + tsnode
-   watch + dev scripts
-   travis deployment with node 12.8

### Info

This needs to be documented more now that it's not a tool used for a 2 day spike

### Notes

-   There's a weird OSX thing where if you have the "tmp" or "gif" folders open in
    finder, while the tool is placing files there, image capture gets messed up.
    You **have** to have any finder windows that are looking at "tmp" or "gif" closed
    or the tool will not save images correctly, which really messes up the gifs
